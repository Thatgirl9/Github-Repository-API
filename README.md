### Description üñº

This is a project from the AltSchool Second Semester Examination. This repository makes use of the Github Repo API. The usage of the API was to fetch my GitHub repositories on a page and to fetch the individual repository when clicked using nested routing. In implementing a 404 Page, an invalid link is created. In implementing an Error Boundary Page, an international error was thrown. This is to meet the requirements.

##### The project contains 4 main pages: 
1. A Home Page.
2. A Single Repository Page.
3.  A 404 Page.
4. A page to test the Error Boundary.

The project is in accordance with the set requirements. The pages are in the [Screenshot](#screenshots) content.
